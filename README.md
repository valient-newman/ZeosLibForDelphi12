This addition gives the support for Embarcadero Delphi 11 to ZeosLib, changed the LibSuffix from 270 to 280 for Delphi 11. 


## What is to be done?
Create subdirectory "Delphi11" in the directory "packages" of the original ZeosLib and copy my files there.
That is all, futher use usual procedure, starting with ZeosDbo.groupproj and so on...
